# Deepfake Detection Browser Extension
### Hack4Impact

## 📖 About This Project
Welcome to our Hack4Impact project - a deepfake detection browser extension. This browser extension will help users identify potential deepfake by analyzing media and providing a confidence percentage regarding it's authenticity. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to assist users in making informed decisions about the content they encouter.

The project could be extended with a user interface, batch processing capabilities, or integration with video platforms for real-time detection.

## 📜 Project Summary
The deepfake detection project works as follows:
Data Preparation: The system extracts faces from videos or processes images, creating a dataset of real and manipulated faces.
Transfer Learning: The model uses MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet) as a feature extractor, then adds custom classification layers on top.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Here’s how you can start using and contributing to this project:
1. Browse the repo
    - Explore existing content and learn more about our deepfake detection browser extension.
2. Setting up your environment
    - Install Python and required libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)
    - Create a virtual environment for your project
3. Prepare your directory structure:
    - Create folders for real and fake images
    - Set up directories for training, validation, and test data
3. Obtain a datset 
    - You'll need labeled data of real and fake images/videos
    - Popular datasets include FaceForensics++, Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset, or DFDC
4. Modify the paths in the code to point to your dataset location
```
python
real_dir = "your/path/to/real/images"
fake_dir = "your/path/to/fake/images"
```

## 👟 Training Process:
The neural network learns to distinguish between authentic and synthetic media through supervised learning with labeled examples.

## 🏃‍♀️ Run the training process:
Execute the main function to train your model
This will take time depending on your hardware and dataset size
Test your model with new images or videos not used in training

## 🕵️ Detection Method: 
The model analyzes visual artifacts and inconsistencies that deepfake algorithms typically leave behind, such as unnatural blending, lighting inconsistencies, or unusual facial movements.

## 🎭 Classification: 
For each input image, the model outputs a probability score between 0 and 1, where scores closer to 1 indicate a real image and scores closer to 0 suggest a fake.
